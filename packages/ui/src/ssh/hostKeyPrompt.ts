 * Props for a dialog that can raise a host-key prompt — "Test connection" in the SSH profile
 * dialog, "Start" in the tunnel dialog.
 *
 * While the question is pending, the dialog underneath stops trapping focus, so the prompt can
 * hold it, and stops accepting pointer input and dismissal, so the connection cannot be answered
 * out from under itself. Everything is restored the moment the prompt is answered.
 *
 * The other half of the arrangement is in `HostKeyDialog`, which takes its own stacking layer.
